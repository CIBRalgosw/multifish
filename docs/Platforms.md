# Platforms

This pipeline is containerized and portable across the various platforms supported by [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io). It has been extensively tested on a standalone workstation, the Janelia compute cluster, and AWS. If you run it successfully on any other platform, please let us know so that we can update this documentation.
