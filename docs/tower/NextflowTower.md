# Nextflow Tower

Nextflow Tower is a web-based GUI that allows you to easily run the pipeline and monitor its progress. Nextflow Tower is a commercial product, but there are some free-to-use installations available. First, decide if you want to run the pipeline at Janelia (requires either VPN or your physical presence on campus) or in the cloud.
