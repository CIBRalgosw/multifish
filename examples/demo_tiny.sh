# Memory Considerations
# =====================
# 
# The value of workers*worker_cores*gb_per_core determines the total Spark memory for each acquisition registration. 
# For the demo, two of these need to fit in main memory. The settings below work for a 40 core machine with 128 GB RAM.
#
# Reducing the gb_per_core to 2 reduces total memory consumption but doubles processing time.
